Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project is a web application that uses a CNN model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) 
drawn by users or uploaded as image files. The model predicts the digit along with the confidence level of 
each possible outcome, and a probablity distribution bar graph for each number. The CNN model achieved 97% accuracy
and is trained and tested on MNIST data, https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz
Built with React, Vite, JavaScript, Python, TensorFlow, and a backend API for model inference.
